FOR JAVA STUFF:
    look in java/TwitterMelodyGenerator/ (it's an eclipse project)
    hopefully TwitterPdOSC.java should be pretty self explanatory.
FOR PD STUFF:
    open up chiptune_band_oscenabled_FORJAVA.pd
    make sure you have MrPeach libraries installed (if you have pd-extended, you're fine)
    if you can, get the freeverb library
    sound should start immediately, if it doesn't, go to the pd main window and click 'turn on DSP' or 'compute audio'



The fully featured band is in chiptune_band.pd, and used by sketch.pd
the shell I was using in the android app is in chiptune_band_core_core.pd
